Sports League Database Management System (ER Model)

This repository contains an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram for a comprehensive sports league database. The architecture is designed to manage the complex logistics of professional sports, including:

1.Core Entity Architecture: Centralized around a Team hub, connecting players, coaches, and match schedules.

2.Relationship Dynamics: Implements 1:M (One-to-Many) relationships for team rosters and medical staff, and an M:N (Many-to-Many) relationship for match participation.

3.Organizational Integrity: Features strict 1:1 Referee-to-Match mapping and tracks professional timelines through ContractStart and ContractEnd attributes.

4.Financial Tracking: Includes a Multiple-Sponsorship model, allowing teams to manage various corporate partnerships efficiently.

The model is optimized for data integrity and normalization, ensuring scalability for human resources, commercial support, and competitive event tracking.
